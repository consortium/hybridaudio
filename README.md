# Hybrid Player Audio

By Daniel Jackson, Lorain Furter, Simon Worthington and many more great people associated to the Hybrid Publishing Consortium.

The Hybrid Player Audio is a media player designed for audio based web publications that also includes images, texts and maps. Hybrid Player Audio (HPA) is a lightweight framework that allows deep linking of all the media used and a timeline along which the media can be syscronised. For example HPA can be used create a slide show to accompany audio playback and have text sycronised to follow the audio.

HPA is open source and the GitHub repository has been designed for you to download and start making your own web publication.

## Philosophy

HPA is a version of the Hybrid Player framework which is aimed at making mobile first and browser based publishing tools for different contexts; lectures, archive publishing, reading etc. The Hybrid Player framework allows for deeping linking, which means you can reference and link to points in any media used. HPA believes in creating platform indepenent content, which is achieved by using open standards and open technologies; HTML5, XML, CSS and Javascript.

## HPA on Rasberry Pi - offline Wifi serving

There is an option to run your HPA publication on its own offline server, using a Rasberry Pi mini computer. The Rasberry Pi creates a local wifi network with browser capture, so as soon as a person logs onto the wifi network their web browser shows your HPA publication.
