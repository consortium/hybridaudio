# Pre-release - please wait before using the software! 23.10

By Daniel Jackson, Loraine Furter, Simon Worthington and many more great people associated to the Hybrid Publishing Consortium.

The Hybrid Player Audio is a media player designed for audio based web publications that can include images, texts and maps. Hybrid Player Audio (HPA) is a lightweight framework that allows deep linking of all the media used and a timeline along which the media can be synchronised. For example HPA can be used create a slide show to accompany audio playback and have text sycronised to follow the audio. 

HPA is currently in a proof of concept rapid prototyping phase as of October 2015. If you like the player and would like to run a workshop or rapid prototyping publishing project please get in touch simon@hpg.io

HPA is open source and the GitHub repository has been designed for to be download to enable the making your own web publication.

## Philosophy

HPA is a version of the Hybrid Player framework which is aimed at making mobile first and browser based publishing tools for different contexts; lectures, archive publishing, reading etc. The Hybrid Player framework allows for deeping linking, which means you can reference and link to points in any media used. HPA believes in creating platform indepenent content, which is achieved by using open standards and open technologies; HTML5, XML, CSS and Javascript.

## HPA on Rasberry Pi - offline Wifi serving

There is an option to run your HPA publication on its own offline server using a Rasberry Pi (RPi) mini computer. The RPi creates a local WiFi network with browser capture, so as soon as a person logs onto the WiFi network their web browser shows your HPA publication.

## Step-by-step Setup Guide



## Hybrid Player 

The Hybrid Player (HP) technology has been in development since February 2015 as a partnership between the Hybrid Publishing Group, Hybrid Publishing Consortium and AVCO ltd. The development process has been led by rapid prototyping publishing projects. First as the '[McLuhan Hybrid Player](https://mcluhan.consortium.io/)' first released at Libre Graphics Meeting in Toronto in April 2015, followed by a workshop at Medialab Prado as 'Hidden Histories, Public Libraries' in June 2015 exploring possibilities of the use of outdoor media screens and Zotero library management. HP is aimed at developing new interfaces for media publishing in the browser.

## Thanks

HPA has been developed in a rapid prototyping workshop called 'Hidden Histories, Public Libraries' taking place at iMal in Brussels. Two museums took part in the workshop to experiment with material from earlier exhibitions and audio collections to try out making web publications and exploring ideas of public engagement.

Hidden Histories, Public Libraries addresses collective digital reading experiences in the public space. With a set of DIY and Open Source tools to publish and access documents in situated locations, the project invites the visitor to participate in its interrogations: in the streets, the user can connected mobile devices to extend the tradition of collective reading experiences? How can people share materials and generate new urban imaginaries? How to enable hidden histories to re-emerge?

Discover sounds, images and other documents from the Brussels' past and the present through your mobile phone and the Hybrid Player application.

HPA rapid prototype and workshop (October 2015) has taken place as part of the Hidden Histories, Public Libraries project and has been made possible by the support of [xm:lab](http://www.xmlab.org/), [Hybrid Publishing Group](http://hpg.io/), in the framework of [Connecting Cities](http://www.imal.org/connectingcities2015) in collaboration with [BNA-BBOT](http://www.bna-bbot.be/) and [La Fonderie](http://www.lafonderie.be/).
